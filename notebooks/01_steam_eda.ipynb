Technical Test Server This is the Technical Test Server client for Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege. This platform will be used to test new features in a controlled environment that allows the development team to iterate without impacting the live game. o Please note : - The T.T.S. client is built off of several different builds at various stages of development, and may not represent the overall quality of the game. - Features seen on the T.T.S. might never make it in the final game: various components are still in conceptual stages and might be discarded throughout the development process. Certain ideas that were postponed or cancelled might also be found in the T.T.S. as a result. - You need to own a version of the game (Standard, Gold, Complete or Starter Edition) to unlock this product - The TTS will only function during specific timeframes.
